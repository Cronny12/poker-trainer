the gernal outline i want for this web app is:
a user loads up the website and then logs in. once they log in they have access to their balance/chips. they receive a certain amount of chips everyday for free. the user can solve brain teasers to get more chips if they want. each day they log in and correctly answer a brain teaser they build upon their streak and the higher their strea the more chips they are awarded upon completion of the brain teaser. 
the user can play a game against bots. the user can select what play style each of the bots have. the max game is 9 players. the user and 8 bots. there are going to be 10 different strategies to choose from and the user can select each bot and their play style. or if they want a randomised one they can select a random amount of each play styles. these games against a bot will not reduce their chip stack but there is a log/record of their wins and losses.
